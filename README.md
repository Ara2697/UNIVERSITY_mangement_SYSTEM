The goal of the university management code is to make managing student data easier.
A'students' table is created by the application using a MysqlÂ that stores important data such names, roll numbers, and departments.
Functions to add student information to the database and retrieve it for viewing are included in the code. Through a simple Python program, 
this succinct script offers a basis for effectively handling and dealing with student data in an academic setting.

This GitHub site has a Python code for running a university more efficiently. Users can add information about students, remove data, and change 
information. There is a search function in the program's menu that lets you quickly find certain people. All of the student information is shown in a 
specialised table view, making it easy to find. This simple and easy-to-use Python tool will help your university better handle its data.
Features:

Input student information
Delete and update records
Search for specific students
Table view for comprehensive student data
Get started with efficient university data management using this Python program.
